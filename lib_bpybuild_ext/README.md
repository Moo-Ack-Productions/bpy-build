# LibBpyBuildExt

LibBpyBuildExt is a BSD 3-Clause reimplementation of the Blender Extension builder, with the goal of creating an implementation of the Blender Extension builder under a more permissive license, and as a library. This exists because the Blender Extension builder, while open source, is under the GPL. Since BpyBuild is under the BSD 3-Clause license, a permissive reimplementation is necessary.

The goal is to have 100% parity with the Blender Extension builder. Part of this includes documenting the extension building process under the hood, to fill in existing gaps in the Blender documentation.
